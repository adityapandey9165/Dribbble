## Introduction
The "Ahead App Redesign Concept" is a project aimed at revamping the existing Ahead app to provide a more user-friendly and impactful experience. The core focus of this redesign is to help individuals in their journey of self-improvement and personal development.

## Project Goal
Our primary goal is to create an app that empowers users to master their own lives by gaining better control over their emotions. We firmly believe that Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is a crucial factor that can often surpass traditional Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in personal and professional success.
